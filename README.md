## Overview ##
Simplr was prototyped in order to allow developers to write minimal code, as spending too much on a specific field of a project can cause one to shy away from the topic at hand.

Here are three original Simplr functions that developers might find useful:

```python
 simplr.wait(duration) # package: time
```
```python
 simplr.lorem(times_repeated) # package: none
```

```python
simplr.folder(directory, foldername) # package: os
```

## Use ##

On the Simplr for Python YouTube channel, we have a series explaining how Simplr works, and why it is beneficial to use when programming. We also have articles posted on our website in order to get you started with Simplr.
