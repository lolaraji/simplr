# Simplr #

## About ##
Simplr was devekloper in order to allow developers to write minimal code, as it can be quite tasky to write tens of hundreds of lines of code in order to achieve a singular problem. Simplr has many different functions (some made using primitives, others using specific libraries) with simple and easy to use wording. 

Here are some original Simplr functions and packages needed in order to acheive them:

* wait(duration)
  * import time

* lorem(times_repeated)
 * No package required!
