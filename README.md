## About ##
Simplr was prototyped in order to allow developers to write minimal code, as spending too much on a specific field of a project can cause one to shy away from the topic at hand.

Here are three original Simplr functions that developers might find useful:
```python
 wait(duration) # package: time
```
```python
 lorem(times_repeated) # package: none
```

```python
folder(directory, foldername) # package: os
```
